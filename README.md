My implementation of the 2017 NIPS paper titled [Protein Interface Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7231-protein-interface-prediction-using-graph-convolutional-networks).

The code in this repository wil reproduce the results described in Table 2 for the following methods:

1. Node Average (Equation 1)
2. Node and Edge Average (Equation 2)
3. Order Dependent (Equation 3)

## Setup
### Requirements
* Python 3.6.3
* TensorFlow 1.4.0
* scikit-learn 0.19.1
